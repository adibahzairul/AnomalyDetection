This project is a fraud detection system, using unsupervised ML models.
The dataset used in this project is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data


In this specific use case, credit card transactions are analysed to detect fraudulent transactions.
I've built 3 models, which are Isolation Forest, OneClass SVM, and DBSCAN. The performance of these models are then evaluated to identify the best performing model(s) for this use case.
